Both light and sound can be abstracted as a mathematical concept: waves. At first glance very different things that share an abstraction, similar to how a computer and a person both can "die". 

The Doppler effect and redshift occur in light and sound, and the only apparent reason is that they are both "waves". It seems that things align based on how they can be abstracted. There are phenomena we can abstract that are not just a line connecting points but have a value the universe agrees upon.
