Both light and sound can be abstracted as a mathematical concept: waves. At first glance very different things that share an abstraction, similar to how a computer and a person both can "die". 

I often think that it must have been such an awesome thing to find out how sound has the Doppler effect, just as light has redshift, for the only apparent reason that they are both waves. It seems that things align based on how they can be abstracted. When we abstarct we are not just drawing a line between points, but rather learning about ways of thinking that the universe itself prefers to use, i.e. the abstraction is part of the thing itself.
