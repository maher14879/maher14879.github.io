Both light and sound can be abstracted as a mathematical concept: waves. At first glance very different things that share an abstraction, similar to how a computer and a person both can "die". 

I often think that it must have been such a shocking, yet awesome thing, to find out how sound has the Doppler effect, just as light has redshift, for the only apparent reason that they are both waves. It seems that things align based on how they can be abstracted. There are phenomena we can abstract that are not just a line connecting points but have a value the universe agrees upon, i.e. the abstraction is part of the thing itself.
