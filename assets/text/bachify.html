In this machine learning project I will sample a lot of Bach pieces and create a model that can predict what Bach would have written.
By doing this i can "Bachify" (trademarked) any piece of music.

造 Part 1: Importing the data
<br><br>

I am currently using www.jsbach.net to gather data, but I will probably switch to another source.
The other source must have midi data, because i use note- and not sound data.
<br><br>

造 Part 2: Preparing the data
<br><br>

I centered all my data around C and removed octave information.
Then i grouped all notes by bar in order and saved them in a json file. 
<br><br>

造 Part 3: Training the model
<br><br>

My first attempt was to use two simple Neural Network, one for the chords and the other for the melody.
The hypothesis was that the chords would be easier to predict than the melody, so if i created a model on all the notes it would predict the chords.
I could then use the chord model to remove chord notes and predict the melody.
This attempt obviously failed because the model was not able to predict the chords or the melody correctly, but it was an easy implementation and a good starting point.
I will still try to have this model run on this website, so i can "finish" the project, in hope of getting using a markovian model and a larger dataset in the future.

造 Part 4: Using the model
<br><br>

To use the model on another midi file, i went through the same steps as in part 2, but then something horrible happened.
My chord model would predict [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10] for every bar, i.e. the C major scale.
Even worse was my note model, which would predict the C note for every bar.
I am throwing the towel in the ring for now, but i will come back to this.
