I am currently in the idea phase of an open world game called Cluster.
<br><br>

¤ Part 1: Main Concept
<br><br>

I have always liked Minecraft. A limitless game that abstracts the world in such an elegant way: everything is divided into one block. 
I want to do something similar, but with a different scale, perspective, and inspiration. Each tile would be analogous to a 20cm x 20cm voxel, and the perspective is locked. 
I.e., the game would be isometric. Although the artistic style for Minecraft is nice, I would like to go in a different direction, making the game more of a world simulator than an action game with objectives. 
In this regard i would be inspired by the game Noita, where everything is a somewhat large pixel of a certain material. My game would fall between these two levels of detail. 
<br><br>

¤ Part 2: Wait, I'm Different!
<br><br>

Some of the things I want in my game are that: 
<pre>
    > No natural health regeneration. Healing must be deliberate. 
    > Potion recipes vary by world, discovered through clues in the world. 
    > Crafting is shapeless and simple, focused on using basic items creatively. 
    > Upon revival, abilities are temporarily hindered.
</pre>
I feel like these changes are unusual for most games since they require a very deliberate approach. 
<br><br>

¤ Part 3: Graver's Son and Other Goofy Guys
<br><br>

My game will have no loading screens, menus, or anything like that. The gameplay starts on a small island. 
I will create handcrafted characters who inhabit this island and teach basic mechanics. 
From this island, you would be able to generate a world for you to play in.
<br><br>
One of these characters is Graver's Son, who is a strong and optimistic guy. 
He works for his dad as the caretaker for the graveyard. 
Although this role might seem easy at first, all the buried people keep rising at night, messing up the graves and stampeding the plants. 
This has led the Graver's Son to become a very skilled zombie killer. 
Most people might not like this job, but the Graver's Son finds it quite exciting to fight off monsters. 
He also does not want to disturb his old dad, who would be devastated to find out that his burial ceremonies lead to the rise of evil monsters, so instead, he accepts that his dad thinks of him as a terrible gardener. 
The Graver's Son will teach you how to kill monsters and how to use a shovel.
