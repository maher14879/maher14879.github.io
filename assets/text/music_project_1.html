My aim with this machine learning project is to sample a lot of Bach pieces and create a model that can predict what Bach would have written.
By doing this i can "Bachify" (trademarked) any piece of music.
This just means that by importing a piece of music, the model will predict what Bach would have written if he had written that piece and play it <span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;">Bach</span>.

¤ Part 1: Importing the data
<br><br>

I am currently using www.jsbach.net to gather data, but I will probably switch to another source that also has midi files.
The reason i am using midi is because it is easy to work with and that i am looking for a way to get the notes and not the sound.

¤ Part 2: Preparing the data
<br><br>

I centered all my data around the note C and removed octave information, using muspy on the midi files.
Then i grouped all notes by bar in order and saved them in a json file. 
This was useful since i could have the training data be the notes in the four bars before the current bar and after that the current bar.

¤ Part 3: Training the model
<br><br>

My first attempt was to use two simple Neural Network, one for the chords and the other for the melody.
The hypothesis was that the chords would be easier to predict than the melody, so if i created a model on all the notes it would predict the chords.
I could then use the chord model to remove chord notes and predict the melody.
This attempt obviously failed because the model was not able to predict the chords or the melody correctly, but it was an easy implementation and a good starting point.
I will still try to have this model run on this website, so i can "finish" the project, in hope of getting using a markovian model and a larger dataset in the future.
