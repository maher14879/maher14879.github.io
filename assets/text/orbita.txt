My code can be viewed on my GitHub, and is only playable using Python.  
I am thinking about remaking it using JavaScript so it can be playable online.

¤ Part 1: What is Orbita  
<br><br>

Orbita is a simple asteroid shooter I made to practice object-oriented programming.  
The project is still ongoing but is in a playable state.  
The objective is to shoot asteroids and collect their Astroiris without being hit.  
You can also shoot a charged bullet that gravitates the asteroids, combining them into a larger asteroid.  
<br><br>
If I remake this project, I would improve the particle system and create a belt object of asteroids that handles updates and collisions.  
<br><br>

¤ Part 2: Music: Into Space  
<br><br>

The soundtrack for the game can be found on Spotify.  
I made it with my friend Konrad (LindebergProd) primarily in one sitting, and I am very proud of our work.  
<br><br>
The spaceship also makes whooshing sounds that scale with speed and movement, which I feel is a very nice touch.  
I would love to improve the sound design of the normal rocket fire. I cannot stress enough how important sound design is for basic and repetitive sounds.  
<br><br>

¤ Part 3: Jittery White Dots  
<br><br>

I spent a lot of time working on giving the asteroids, spaceship, and bullets life by adding particles with a similar color.  
This gave life to a somewhat empty game.  
I will take this with me in my later projects, but I will make my particles more deliberate and physics-based, with gravity, weight, and so on.  
<br><br>

¤ Part 4: Asteroids  
<br><br>

I chose to make asteroids based on real images that I scaled down and drew.  
This opens options for creating an index with the different asteroid names, where they were found, and so on.  
I think this would be greatly appreciated by the astronomy community.  
<br><br>

¤ Part 5: You Died, But Your Death Inspired Others  
<br><br>

Dying makes you receive motivational death messages.  
This is inspired by *Undertale* but is based on quotes that I find convincing for myself:
<br><br>
> "You lose, yet try again... 
<br>
> that's why others depend on you."
<br><br>
> "It will take you long...  
<br>
> but the time will pass anyway."  
<br><br>

¤ Part 6: Someone Answered Your Call  
<br><br>

Something my game lacks is story and gameplay.  
I would like to add waves of asteroids, giving you a feeling of accomplishment after defeating each wave.  
I would like to add a captain who has a motive that answers why we are collecting the asteroids.
