            A few years ago i made a Minecraft Forge mod for version 1.20.1 using MCreator (a visual programming tool made for making Minecraft Mods). 
            It was a fun project that taught me a lot about game design. 
            The mod is playable and somewhat fun, although some parts are not very polished. 
            You can download it here and play it for yourself!
