            The paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46765-w" >"Maximum Entropy (Most Likely) Double Helical and Double Logarithmic Spiral Trajectories in Space-Time"</a> by M. C. Parker & C. Jeynes, 
            shows there exists a scale invariant model between the double helix of our DNA and the double-armed spirals of our Galaxy. 
            Using Shannon entropy, Parker & Jeynes were able to show that both DNA and our Galaxy are maximum entropy structures and calculate real observations like the mass of the mikly way, even accounting for dark matter!

                Shannon entropy is a probabilistic method of calculating uncertainty in an information system. For discrete cases, the formula is given by \(H(x) = -\sum_i p(X=x_i) \log p(X=x_i)\), where \(p\) is the propability function.

                Imagine three different bins:
                <br><br>
                > 1 XXXX — 4 marked, 0 unmarked<br>
                > 2 XXXO — 3 marked, 1 unmarked<br>
                > 3 XXOO — 2 marked, 2 unmarked<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Now imagine a game where you choose one bin. From that bin, you pick 4 at random, with replacement after each pick.
                You win the game if your sequence of picks exactly matches the composition of the bin.
            </p>

            <p>
                The probability of losing is analogous to Shannon entropy. The more uniform the bin, the higher its entropy and the harder it is to guess the exact sequence.
                Bin 3 is the most unpredictable and has the highest entropy. Bin 1 is fully predictable and has the lowest.

            In my article about abstraction, I wrote "So the next time you feel the urge to study the spiral shape of galaxies, maybe the inside of nautilus shells could be a good place to start".
            Parker & Jeynes did exactly that! They used two logarithmic spirals to represent the center of each arm in the Milky Way, which is a ubiquitous geometric patterns in nature, first formalized by René Descartes in the 1630s, who observed it in (most notoriously) nautilus shells.
            By looking at nature and wondering about the beauty of shells and galaxies, we are able to create abstractions that are so deep in nature, that they are true for both the smallest and largest things in the universe, and everything in between.
