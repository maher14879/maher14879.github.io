            <strong>[Guide Node]</strong>
            Contrary to popular belief, we were not put on earth with a manual on how to live life, so I have put it upon myself to create one!
            
            This manual takes the form of a tree structure, with two distinct types of nodes:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>A guide node, that talks about a specific part of life (like this one)</li>
          <li>A challenge node, that gives you something specific to do</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            The tree follows three rules:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Nodes closer to the root are always more important than ones lower down</li>
          <li>All parents of a challenge node must be completed</li>
          <li>Each child is just as important as any of their siblings</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            The manual starts with the following five guide nodes:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li class="hover-text"><a href="virtue.html">Virtue</a> <span>How good you are to others?</span></li>
          <li class="hover-text"><a href="body.html">Body</a> <span>Do you take care of your body?</span></li>
          <li class="hover-text"><a href="mind.html">Mind</a> <span>What is going on in your mind?</span></li>
          <li class="hover-text"><a href="food.html">Food</a> <span>What are you made of?</span></li>
          <li class="hover-text"><a href="soul.html">Soul</a> <span>What are you even doing here?</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
