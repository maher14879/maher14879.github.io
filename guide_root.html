        <p>
            Contrary to popular belief, we were not put on earth with a manual on how to live life, so I have put it upon myself to create one!
            
            This manual takes the form of a tree structure, with two distinct types of nodes:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>A chapter node, that talks about a specific part of life</li>
          <li>A challenge node, that gives you something specific to do</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            The tree follows three rules:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Nodes closer to the root are always more important</li>
          <li>All parents of a challenge node must be completed</li>
          <li>Each child is just as important as any of their siblings</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            The manual has five initial chapters:
