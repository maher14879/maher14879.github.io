            My code can be viewed on my <a href="https://github.com/maher14879/Orbita" >GitHub</a>, and is only playable using Python.  
            I am thinking about remaking it using JavaScript so it can be played online.  
            <br><br>
            
            ¤ Part 1: What is Orbita  
            <br><br>
            
            Orbita is a simple asteroid shooter I made to practice object-oriented programming.
            The objective is to shoot asteroids and collect a resource called Astroiris.  
            You can also shoot a charged bullet that gravitates the asteroids, combining them into one larger asteroid.  
            <br><br>
            If I remake this project, I would improve the particle system and create a belt object of asteroids that handles updates and collisions.  
            <br><br>
            
            ¤ Part 2: Music and Sound
            <br><br>
            
            The soundtrack for the game can be found on Spotify.  
            I made it with my friend Konrad (LindebergProd) primarily in one sitting, and I am very proud of our work.  
            <br><br>
            The spaceship also makes whooshing sounds that scale with speed and movement, which I feel is a very nice touch.  
            I would love to improve the sound design of the normal rocket fire. I cannot stress enough how important sound design is for basic and repetitive sounds.  
            <br><br>
            
            ¤ Part 3: Jittery White Dots  
            <br><br>
            
            I spent a lot of time working on giving the asteroids, spaceship, and bullets life by adding particles with a similar color.  
            This gave life to a somewhat empty game.  
            I will take this with me in my later projects, but I will make my particles more deliberate and physics-based, with gravity, weight, and so on.  
            <br><br>
            
            ¤ Part 4: Asteroids  
            <br><br>
            
            I chose to make asteroids based on real images that I scaled down and drew.  
            I like to imagine that this must be greatly appreciated by the astronomy community. 
            I should have made a glossary with the names of the asteroids, how the pictures were taken and who took them.
            <br><br>
            
            ¤ Part 5: You Died, But Your Death Inspired Others  
            <br><br>
            
            When you die, you receive a motivational messages.  
            This is inspired by Undertale, but is based on quotes that I find appealing:
            <br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 14px;">
                &gt; "You lose, yet try again... <br>
                &gt; that's why others depend on you."<br><br>
                &gt; "It will take you long...  <br>
                &gt; but the time will pass anyway." 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            
            ¤ Part 6: Someone Answered Your Call  
            <br><br>
            
            Something my game lacks is story and dynamic gameplay.  
            I would like to add waves of asteroids, giving you a feeling of accomplishment after defeating each wave, and a captain who has a motive that explains why we are destoying the asteroids in the first place.
