            There are lots of reasons why video games are fun, but playing them aint one!

            <br><br>
            Making video games must be one of the best ways to teach yourself programming. 
            It is the no man's land between abstraction and reality. 
            You must embody the physicist who abstracts things into objects with properties that interact and the pragmatist who adds arbitrary boundaries that ensure proper gameplay. 
            The choice between abstraction and optimization is central to programming, and a skilled programmer knows how to balance both.
            <br><br>
            ¤ Part 2: How can I make this about myself?
            <br><br>
            My project <a href="orbita.html" >Orbita</a> started as a physics simulator but ended up being very unscalable because I found my vision and only did what was necessary to achieve that vision. 
            Now I am working on another project <a href="iso_arcade.html" >IsoArcade</a>, which is an open-world game with no direct limits on what the player can do. 
            This forces me to focus a lot on abstracting in a smart way, that makes the player's control feel realistic, without having to code the weak nuclear force.
